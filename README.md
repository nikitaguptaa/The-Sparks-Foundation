Data Science and Analytics Internship -GRIP tasks (Graduate Rotational Internship Program)                                                                  
This repository is for storing code related to internship at The SPARKS Foundation

(TASK - 2) - This folder contains data of some students. Task is to predict whether score increases if number of hours of study increases. We performed EDA and fitted a linear Regression model for this data.

(TASK - 3) - This folder is for the iris data analysis using KMeans algorithm. First plots were generated and features visualised.We determined the ideal number of clusters using elbow method and it too came out to be 3. Lastly, we plotted a confusion matrix to see the classification.

(TASK - 4) - In this task we were to explore Decision Tree Algorithm using sklearn on IRIS dataset. First we splitted the data into train and test part. Then we fitted a DecisionTreeClassifier on the dataset. For visulaising it, we used matplotlib.

(TASK - 5) - In this final task, we were to analyse a business data and see how the company is performing.The visuals of the data are created using Tableau and insights of weak areas are derived where the company can focus more to increase more profit.
